Paper to be implemented : Real-Time Tracking of Non-Rigid Ob jects using Mean Shift (http://comaniciu.net/Papers/MsTracking.pdf)

Dataset : Several short videos consisting of moving objects. We plan to create our own videos for testing the algorithm.

Evaluation/Validation Strategy : We plan to test the correctness of implementation by visual inspection. If the algorithm works properly, it will track the object throughout all frames.
