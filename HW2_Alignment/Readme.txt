Write down answers to Q2, Q3, Q4, Q6, Q7 in the report. For Q1 and Q5, write down answers to the questions, in the report.
But the code should be placed in the sub-folder named 'code' inside Q1 or Q5. All the required input data should be placed in the sub-folder
named 'input' inside Q1 or Q5. All sample outputs (if any) should be placed inside the sub-folder named 'output' inside
Q1 or Q5. Your code should prompt the user to specify the path to a folder containing the input data. For this, use the MATLAB command
uigetdir.
